# Welcome to the Amazing Central Registry #

It is an initiative that seeks to generate a base knowledge management of the most used tools in three main areas: Infrastructure as Code, Configuration Management, and Scripting, being a guide composed of good practices, standards, libraries, and examples that allow optimizing the development tasks of the Globlers belonging to the CloudOps study.

A resource is hereinafter understood as any composition of code that fulfills a specific responsibility, is standardized and versioned.

## InnerSource Framework

The objective of the framework is to define the guidelines that allow the resources managed in the initiative to be standardized, evolve and be sustainable over time.

The framework is composed of three pillars that are described below:

- **How to Work**: Establishes the guidelines for building new resources. [More info](docs/how_to_work)

- **How to Contribute**: Defines the process for releasing a new resource so that it can be consumed by the Globant CloudOps community.

- **How to Use**: Defines how the consumer community can make use of the resources and how they can support the evolution of the resources over time.
